# CS50x Finance
by Ford Torion

## Description
A web app that simulates a user who can register and log in an account, get stock quotes, buy stocks, sell stocks, view transaction history, and view his stock portfolio.

## Distribution Code
Like other problem sets in CS50x, the Finance distribution code comes with pre-written code by the CS50 staff like the helpers.py which has the lookup() function that uses Yahoo API to get stock information from the Yahoo stock market. As sthe student taking this course, my task was to develop the back-end routes, create the necessary HTML templates, and create the necessary tables in the database.
